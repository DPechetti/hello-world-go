## Create a Go module

- Create a module -> Write a small module with functions you can call from another module.
- Call your code from another module -> Import and use your new module.
- Return and handle an error -> Add simple error handling.
- Return a random greeting -> Handle data in slices (Go's dynamically-sized arrays).
- Return greetings for multiple people -> Store key/value pairs in a map.
- Add a test -> Use Go's built-in unit testing features to test your code.
- Compile and install the application -> Compile and install your code locally.
