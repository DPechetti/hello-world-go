hello world made with golang following the documentation

## But is not just that

### Documentation

- [x] Create a module -> Write a small module with functions you can call from another module.
- [x] Call your code from another module -> Import and use your new module.
- [x] Return and handle an error -> Add simple error handling.
- [x] Return a random greeting -> Handle data in slices (Go's dynamically-sized arrays).
- [x] Return greetings for multiple people -> Store key/value pairs in a map.
- [x] Add a test -> Use Go's built-in unit testing features to test your code.

#### Hello

```
These example programs demonstrate different aspects of Go. The programs in the tour are meant to be starting points for your own experimentation.

#### Sandbox

```
This tour is built atop the Go Playground, a web service that runs on golang.org's servers.

The service receives a Go program, compiles, links, and runs the program inside a sandbox, then returns the output.

There are limitations to the programs that can be run in the playground:

In the playground the time begins at 2009-11-10 23:00:00 UTC (determining the significance of this date is an exercise for the reader). This makes it easier to cache programs by giving them deterministic output.
There are also limits on execution time and on CPU and memory usage, and the program cannot access external network hosts.
The playground uses the latest stable release of Go.

Read "[Inside the Go Playground](https://go.dev/blog/playground)" to learn more.
